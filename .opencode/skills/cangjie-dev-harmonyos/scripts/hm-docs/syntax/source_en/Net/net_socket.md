# Socket Programming

Cangjie's socket programming refers to the implementation of network packet transmission functionality based on transport layer protocols.

In reliable transmission scenarios, Cangjie initiates both client and server sockets. The client socket must specify the remote address to connect to and may optionally bind to a local address. Only after a successful connection can it send and receive messages. The server socket, on the other hand, must bind to a local address, and only after successful binding can it send and receive messages.

In unreliable transmission scenarios, sockets do not need to distinguish between client and server roles. Cangjie initiates two sockets for data transmission. The sockets must bind to local addresses, and only after successful binding can they send and receive messages. Additionally, sockets may optionally specify a remote connection address. When specified, the socket will only accept messages from that particular remote address, and when sending (via `send`), there's no need to specify the remote address as messages will automatically be sent to the successfully connected address.

## TCP Programming

As a common reliable transmission protocol, using TCP-type sockets as an example, Cangjie's reference programming model for reliable transmission scenarios is as follows:

1. Create a server socket and specify the local binding address.
2. Perform binding.
3. Execute the accept operation, which will block until a client socket connection is obtained.
4. Synchronously create a client socket and specify the remote address to connect to.
5. Perform the connection.
6. After successful connection, the server will return a new socket through the accept interface. At this point, the server can perform read/write operations (i.e., send/receive messages) through this socket, while the client can directly perform read/write operations.

Example of TCP server and client programs:

<!-- verify -->

```cangjie
import std.time.*
import std.sync.*
import std.net.*

var SERVER_PORT: UInt16 = 0

func runTcpServer() {
    try (serverSocket = TcpServerSocket(bindAt: SERVER_PORT)) {
        serverSocket.bind()
        SERVER_PORT = (serverSocket.localAddress as IPSocketAddress)?.port ?? 0

        try (client = serverSocket.accept()) {
            let buf = Array<Byte>(10, repeat: 0)
            let count = client.read(buf)

            // Data read by server: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
            println("Server read ${count} bytes: ${buf}")
        }
    }
}

main(): Int64 {
    let future = spawn {
        runTcpServer()
    }
    sleep(Duration.millisecond * 500)

    try (socket = TcpSocket("127.0.0.1", SERVER_PORT)) {
        socket.connect()
        socket.write([1, 2, 3])
    }

    future.get()

    return 0
}
```

Compiling and executing the above code will print:

```text
Server read 3 bytes: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## UDP Programming

As a common unreliable transmission protocol, using UDP-type sockets as an example, Cangjie's reference programming model for unreliable transmission scenarios is as follows:

1. Create a socket and specify the local binding address.
2. Perform binding.
3. Specify the remote address for message sending.
4. Without connecting to a remote address, the socket can receive messages from different remote addresses and return the remote address information.

Example of UDP message sending/receiving program:

<!-- verify -->

```cangjie
import std.time.*
import std.sync.*
import std.net.*

let SERVER_PORT: UInt16 = 8080

func runUpdServer() {
    try (serverSocket = UdpSocket(bindAt: SERVER_PORT)) {
        serverSocket.bind()

        let buf = Array<Byte>(3, repeat: 0)
        let (clientAddr, count) = serverSocket.receiveFrom(buf)
        let sender = (clientAddr as IPSocketAddress)?.address.toString() ?? ""

        // Server receive 3 bytes: [1, 2, 3] from 127.0.0.1
        println("Server receive ${count} bytes: ${buf} from ${sender}")
    }
}

main(): Int64 {
    let future = spawn {
        runUpdServer()
    }
    sleep(Duration.second)

    try (udpSocket = UdpSocket(bindAt: 0)) {
        udpSocket.sendTimeout = Duration.second * 2
        udpSocket.bind()
        udpSocket.sendTo(
            IPSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", SERVER_PORT),
            [1, 2, 3]
        )
    }

    future.get()

    return 0
}
```

Compiling and executing the above code will print:

```text
Server receive 3 bytes: [1, 2, 3] from 127.0.0.1
```

# Subtyping Relationships of Generic Types

Instantiated generic types also have subtyping relationships. For example:

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
interface I<X, Y> { }

class C<Z> <: I<Z, Z> { }
```

Based on `class C<Z> <: I<Z, Z> { }`, we know that `C<Bool> <: I<Bool, Bool>` and `C<D> <: I<D, D>` hold, among others. This can be interpreted as "For all types `Z` without type variables, `C<Z> <: I<Z, Z>` holds."

However, for the following code:

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
open class C { }
class D <: C { }

interface I<X> { }
```

`I<D> <: I<C>` does not hold (even though `D <: C` holds). This is because in the Cangjie language, user-defined type constructors are **invariant** at their type parameters.

The formal definition of variance is: If `A` and `B` are (instantiated) types, and `T` is a type constructor with a type parameter `X` (e.g., `interface T<X>`), then:

- If `T(A) <: T(B)` if and only if `A = B`, then `T` is **invariant**.
- If `T(A) <: T(B)` if and only if `A <: B`, then `T` is **covariant** at `X`.
- If `T(A) <: T(B)` if and only if `B <: A`, then `T` is **contravariant** at `X`.

In the current version of Cangjie, all user-defined generic types are invariant at all their type parameters. Therefore, given `interface I<X>` and types `A`, `B`, `I<A> <: I<B>` holds only if `A = B`. Conversely, if `I<A> <: I<B>` is known, we can deduce `A = B` (with the exception of built-in types: built-in tuple types are covariant at each of their element types; built-in function types are contravariant at their parameter types and covariant at their return types.)

Invariance limits some expressive power of the language but also avoids certain safety issues, such as the "covariant array runtime exception" problem.

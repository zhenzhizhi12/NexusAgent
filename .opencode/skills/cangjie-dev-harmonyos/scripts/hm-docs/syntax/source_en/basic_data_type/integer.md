# Integer Types

Integer types are divided into signed integer types and unsigned integer types.

**Signed integer types** include `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, and `IntNative`, which are used to represent signed integer values with encoding lengths of `8-bit`, `16-bit`, `32-bit`, `64-bit`, and platform-dependent sizes, respectively.

**Unsigned integer types** include `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`, and `UIntNative`, which are used to represent unsigned integer values with encoding lengths of `8-bit`, `16-bit`, `32-bit`, `64-bit`, and platform-dependent sizes, respectively.

For a signed integer type with an encoding length of `N`, its representable range is: $-2^{N-1} \sim 2^{N-1}-1$; for an unsigned integer type with an encoding length of `N`, its representable range is: $0 \sim 2^{N}-1$. The following table lists the representable ranges of all integer types:

| Type        | Representable Range                                                                                |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Int8       | $-2^7 \sim 2^7-1 (-128 \sim 127)$                                                   |
| Int16      | $-2^{15} \sim 2^{15}-1 (-32,768 \sim 32,767)$                                       |
| Int32      | $-2^{31} \sim 2^{31}-1 (-2,147,483,648 \sim 2,147,483,647)$                         |
| Int64      | $-2^{63} \sim 2^{63}-1 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 \sim 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)$ |
| IntNative  | platform dependent                                                                  |
| UInt8      | $0 \sim 2^8-1 (0 \sim 255)$                                                         |
| UInt16     | $0 \sim 2^{16}-1 (0 \sim 65,535)$                                                   |
| UInt32     | $0 \sim 2^{32}-1 (0 \sim 4,294,967,295)$                                            |
| UInt64     | $0 \sim 2^{64}-1 (0 \sim 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)$                               |
| UIntNative | platform dependent                                                                  |

The choice of which integer type to use in a program depends on the nature and range of the integers to be processed. When `Int64` is suitable, it is preferred because its representable range is sufficiently large, and [integer literals](./integer.md#integer-literals) default to `Int64` type in the absence of type context, avoiding unnecessary type conversions. Additionally, the Cangjie programming language provides `IntNative` and `UIntNative` as signed and unsigned integer types, respectively, with bit widths consistent with the current system. This means their sizes depend on the platform they run on, allowing them to automatically adapt to the system's bit width in cross-platform development.

## Integer Literals

Integer literals can be represented in 4 radix forms: binary (with `0b` or `0B` prefix), octal (with `0o` or `0O` prefix), decimal (no prefix), and hexadecimal (with `0x` or `0X` prefix). For example, the decimal number `24` can be represented as `0b00011000` (or `0B00011000`) in binary, `0o30` (or `0O30`) in octal, and `0x18` (or `0X18`) in hexadecimal.

In any radix representation, underscores `_` can be used as separators to improve readability, such as `0b0001_1000`.

If the value of an integer literal exceeds the representable range of the required integer type in the context, the compiler will report an error.

<!-- compile.error -->

```cangjie
let x: Int8 = 128          // Error, 128 out of the range of Int8
let y: UInt8 = 256         // Error, 256 out of the range of UInt8
let z: Int32 = 0x8000_0000 // Error, 0x8000_0000 out of the range of Int32
```

When using integer literals, suffixes can be added to explicitly specify the type of the literal. The correspondence between suffixes and types is as follows:

|  Suffix  | Type   |  Suffix  | Type    |
| :----- | :---- | :----  | :----- |
| i8     | Int8  | u8     | UInt8  |
| i16    | Int16 | u16    | UInt16 |
| i32    | Int32 | u32    | UInt32 |
| i64    | Int64 | u64    | UInt64 |

Integer literals with suffixes can be used in the following ways:

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
var x = 100i8  // x is 100 with type Int8
var y = 0x10u64 // y is 16 with type UInt64
var z = 0o432i32  // z is 282 with type Int32
```

## Character Byte Literals

The Cangjie programming language supports character byte literals to facilitate the representation of `UInt8` values using ASCII codes. A character byte literal consists of the character `b`, a pair of single quotes, and an `ASCII` character, for example:

<!-- compile -->

```cangjie
var a = b'x'                    // a is 120 with type UInt8
var b = b'\n'                   // b is 10 with type UInt8
var c = b'\u{78}'               // c is 120 with type UInt8
c = b'\u{90}' - b'\u{66}' + c   // c is 162 with type UInt8
```

`b'x'` represents a literal value of type `UInt8` with a value of 120. Additionally, the escape form `b'\u{78}'` can be used to represent a literal value of type `UInt8` with a hexadecimal value of 0x78 or a decimal value of 120. Note that the `\u` escape sequence can contain at most two hexadecimal digits, and the value must be less than 256 (in decimal).

## Operations Supported by Integer Types

Integer types natively support the following operators: arithmetic operators, bitwise operators, relational operators, increment and decrement operators, and compound assignment operators. The precedence of these operators can be found in the [Operators](../Appendix/operator.md) section of the appendix.

Conversions are allowed between integer types, as well as between integer and floating-point types. Integer types can also be converted to character types. For specific syntax and rules on type conversions, refer to [Numeric Type Conversions](../class_and_interface/typecast.md#numeric-type-conversions).

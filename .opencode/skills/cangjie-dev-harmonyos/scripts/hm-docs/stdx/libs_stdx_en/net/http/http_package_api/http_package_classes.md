Function: General request function that sends [HttpRequest](http_package_classes.md#class-httprequest) to the server specified in the URL and receives [HttpResponse](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponse).

> **Note:**
>
> - For HTTP/1.1, if the request has a body to send, ensure that either Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding: chunked is present (but not both). When sending in chunked form, each chunk must not exceed 8192 bytes. If the body is a custom InputStream class, the user must ensure that either Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding: chunked is set (but not both). If the user uses the default body sender and both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: chunked are missing, we will add a Content-Length header with the value body.size.
> - If the user sets Content-Length, its correctness must be ensured: If the body content is greater than or equal to the Content-Length value, we will send data of length Content-Length. If the body content is less than the Content-Length value and the body is the default body, [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) will be thrown. If the body is a custom InputStream class, the behavior cannot be guaranteed (may cause server-side read request timeout or client-side receive response timeout).
> - Upgrade functions are sent via [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket)'s upgradeFromClient or [Client](http_package_classes.md#class-client)'s [upgrade](http_package_funcs.md#func-upgradehttpcontext) interface. Calling other client functions to send [upgrade](http_package_funcs.md#func-upgradehttpcontext) requests will throw an exception.
> - The protocol specifies that TRACE requests cannot carry content, so sending a TRACE request with a body will throw an exception.
> - HTTP/1.1 defaults to a maximum of 10 connections to the same server. The response body must be read by calling `body.read(buf: Array<Byte>)`. The connection can only be reused by the client object after the body is fully read; otherwise, new connections will be created for requests to the same server. If the connection limit is exceeded when creating a new connection, [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) will be thrown.
> - The body.read function returns 0 after the body is fully read. If the connection is interrupted during reading, [ConnectionException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-connectionexception) will be thrown.
> - For HTTP/1.1 upgrade requests, receiving a 101 response indicates a protocol switch, and this connection is no longer managed by the client.
> - The notes for the following convenience request functions are the same as for send.

Parameters:

- req: [HttpRequest](http_package_classes.md#class-httprequest) - The request to send.

Return Value:

- [HttpResponse](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponse) - The response returned by the server for processing the request.

Exceptions:

- [UrlSyntaxException](../../../encoding/url/url_package_api/url_package_exceptions.md#class-urlsyntaxexception) - Thrown when the [URL](../../../encoding/url/url_package_api/url_package_classes.md#class-url) in the request is incorrect.
- SocketException - Thrown when a socket connection error occurs.
- [ConnectionException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-connectionexception) - Thrown when the peer closes the connection while reading data.
- SocketTimeoutException - Thrown when a socket connection times out.
- [TlsException](../../tls/tls_package_api/tls_package_exceptions.md#class-tlsexception) - Thrown when TLS connection establishment fails or communication errors occur.
- [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) - Thrown when the user does not use the http library's API to upgrade [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket).
- [HttpTimeoutException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httptimeoutexception) - Thrown when the request times out or reading [HttpResponse](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponse).body times out.

### func upgrade(HttpRequest)

```cangjie
public func upgrade(req: HttpRequest): (HttpResponse, ?StreamingSocket)
```

Function: Sends a request and upgrades the protocol. The user sets the request headers, and the upgraded connection (if successful) is returned. The user is responsible for closing the connection.

> **Description:**
>
> - A server response of 101 indicates a successful upgrade, and a StreamingSocket is obtained.
> - Required request headers:
>     - Upgrade: protocol-name ["/" protocol-version];
>     - Connection: Upgrade (automatically added when the Upgrade field is included in the request headers);
> - HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/2 are not supported.
> - HTTP/1.1 CONNECT method [HttpRequest](http_package_classes.md#class-httprequest) is not supported.

Parameters:

- req: [HttpRequest](http_package_classes.md#class-httprequest) - The request sent during the upgrade.

Return Value:

- ([HttpResponse](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponse), ?StreamingSocket) - Returns a tuple where [HttpResponse](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponse) represents the server's response, and ?StreamingSocket represents the underlying connection obtained (None if the upgrade fails).

Exceptions:

- [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) -
    - The request or response message does not comply with the protocol;
    - The request message lacks an Upgrade header;
    - Sending a CONNECT request;
    - Sending a TRACE request with a body;
- SocketException, [ConnectionException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-connectionexception) - Socket connection errors or closures;
- SocketTimeoutException - Socket connection timeout;

## class Cookie

```cangjie
public class Cookie {

        domain!: String = "", path!: String = "", secure!: Bool = false, httpOnly!: Bool = false)
}
```

Function: HTTP is inherently stateless. To allow servers to track client state and provide personalized services, [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) can be used to maintain a stateful session.

> **Note:**
>
> - When a user first visits a site, the server sends name/value pairs and attribute-values to the user agent via the `Set-Cookie` header. Subsequent requests to the site from the user agent can include these name/value pairs in the Cookie header.
> - The [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) class provides functions to construct [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) objects and convert them into `Set-Cookie` header values, as well as functions to retrieve the attribute values of [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) objects.
> - The requirements and roles of each attribute of [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) are defined in [RFC 6265](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc6265.html).
> - Terms such as cookie-name, cookie-value, and expires-av used below are adopted from [RFC 6265](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc6265.html). For details, refer to the protocol.

Function: [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) constructor.

This constructor checks whether the input attributes comply with protocol requirements. If not, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. Specific requirements are detailed in [RFC 6265 4.1.1.](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc6265.html#sane-set-cookie-syntax).

> **Note:**
>
> Among the attributes of [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie), only cookie-name and cookie-value are mandatory. The `name` and `value` parameters must be provided, but `value` can be an empty string.

Parameters:

- name: String - The cookie-name attribute.

    ```cangjie
    name         = token
    token        = 1*tchar
    tchar        = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*"
                   / "+" / "-" / "." / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                   / DIGIT / ALPHA
    ```

- value: String - The cookie-value attribute.

    ```cangjie
    value        = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )
    cookie-octet = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
                ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,
                ; whitespace DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,
                ; and backslash
    ```

- expires!: ?DateTime - Sets the expiration time of the [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie). Default is None. The time must be after 1601.
- maxAge!: ?Int64 - The maximum lifecycle of the [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie). Default is None. If the [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) has both expires and maxAge attributes, it will only persist until the session ends (until the [Client](http_package_classes.md#class-client) closes; after closure, expired [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) will no longer be maintained).

    ```cangjie
    max-age-av     = "Max-Age=" non-zero-digit *DIGIT
    non-zero-digit = %x31-39
                    ; digits 1 through 9
    DIGIT          = %x30-39
                    ; digits 0 through 9
    ```

- domain!: String - Default is an empty string, indicating that the client receiving this [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) will only send it to the original server. If a valid domain is set, the client will send the [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) to all subdomains of that domain (and only if other attribute conditions are met).

    ```cangjie
    domain          = <subdomain> | " "
    <subdomain>   ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>
    <label>       ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]
    <ldh-str>     ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>
    <let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"
    <let-dig>     ::= <letter> | <digit>
    <letter>      ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in upper case and a through z in lower case
    <digit>       ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9
    RFC 1035 2.3.1.
    RFC 1123 2.1. relaxes the restriction that the first character of a label must be a letter.
    Therefore, domain requirements are:
    1. Total length ≤ 255, composed of multiple labels.
    2. Labels are separated by ".", each label length ≤ 63.
    3. The start and end of a label must be a digit or letter; intermediate characters can be digits, letters, or "-".
    ```

- path!: String - Default is an empty string. The client will calculate the default path attribute based on the URL (see RFC 6265 5.1.4.). The client will only send this [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) to all subdirectories of this path (and only if other attribute conditions are met).

    ```cangjie
    path            = <any RUNE except CTLs or ";">
    RUNE            = <any [USASCII] character>
    CTLs            = <controls>
    ```

- secure!: Bool - Default is false. If set to true, this [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) will only be sent in secure protocol requests.
- httpOnly!: Bool - Default is false. If set to true, this [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) will only be sent in HTTP protocol requests.

Exceptions:

- IllegalArgumentException - Thrown when input parameters do not meet protocol requirements.

### func toSetCookieString()

```cangjie
public func toSetCookieString(): String
```

Function: Provides a method to convert [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) to a string format, facilitating server-side `Set-Cookie` header configuration.

> **Note:**
>
> - [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) attributes (including name and value) are checked during object creation, so toSetCookieString() will not throw exceptions.
> - The mandatory attribute of [Cookie](http_package_classes.md#class-cookie) is the cookie-pair (cookie-name "=" cookie-value). The cookie-value can be an empty string. The toSetCookieString() function only writes set attributes to the string, meaning only "cookie-name=" is mandatory; other parts depend on whether they are set.

Return Value:

- String - A string object for setting the `Set-Cookie` header.

## class FileHandler

- If the file does not exist, a 404 status code is returned.

File Upload:

- When constructing [FileHandler](http_package_classes.md#class-filehandler), provide an existing directory path. Uploaded files will be saved in this directory.
- Only POST requests are allowed for uploads; other requests return a 400 status code.
- The HTTP request must be in `multipart/form-data` format, with the `Content-Type` header value as `multipart/form-data; boundary=----XXXXX`.
- The uploaded file's name is stored in the `form-data` payload, formatted as `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="xxx"; filename="xxxx"`, where the filename is the value of the `filename` field.
- Currently, the form-data must include the filename field.
- If the request is malformed, a 400 status code is returned.
- For other exceptions (e.g., file processing errors), a 500 status code is returned.

Parent Type:

- [HttpRequestHandler](http_package_interfaces.md#interface-httprequesthandler)

h1 Request Validation and Processing:

- If request-line does not comply with RFC 9112 rules (request-line = method SP request-target SP HTTP-version), returns 400 response;
- Method consists of tokens and is case-sensitive; request-target must be a parsable URL; HTTP-version must be HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1, otherwise returns 400 response;
- Headers name and value must comply with specific rules (see [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) class documentation), otherwise returns 400 response;
- When headers size exceeds server's maxRequestHeaderSize setting, automatically returns 431 response;
- Headers must include "host" header with a unique value, otherwise returns 400 response;
- Headers cannot simultaneously contain "content-length" and "transfer-encoding", otherwise returns 400 response;
- For "transfer-encoding" header, the last value after splitting by "," must be "chunked", and previous values cannot contain "chunked", otherwise returns 400 response;
- For "content-length" header, value must be parsable as Int64 type and non-negative, otherwise returns 400 response. If value exceeds server's maxRequestBodySize, returns 413 response;
- If headers lack both "content-length" and "transfer-encoding: chunked", body is assumed absent by default;
- For "trailer" header, values cannot include "transfer-encoding", "trailer", or "content-length";
- For "expect" header, values containing anything other than "100-continue" will return 417 response;
- HTTP/1.0 defaults to short-lived connections. To maintain persistent connections, include headers "connection: keep-alive" and "keep-alive: timeout = XX, max = XX" to automatically maintain connections for specified timeout duration. HTTP/1.1 defaults to persistent connections. Failed request parsing closes the connection;
- Trailers are only allowed in chunked mode, and trailer entry names must be included in the "trailer" header, otherwise they will be automatically removed.

h1 Response Validation and Processing:

- If user doesn't configure response, automatically returns 200 response;
- If received request contains "connection: close" header but response configuration lacks "connection" header or its value doesn't include "close", automatically adds "connection: close". If received request lacks "connection: close" and response lacks "connection: keep-alive", automatically adds it;
- If headers contain hop-by-hop response headers: "proxy-connection", "keep-alive", "te", "transfer-encoding", "upgrade", these will be automatically added to "connection" header value;
- Automatically adds "date" response header, user-provided "date" will be ignored;
- If request method is "HEAD" or response status code is "1XX\204\304", body will be configured as empty;
- When body length is known, it will be compared with "content-length" header. If header is absent, it will be automatically added with body length value. If header value exceeds body length, throws [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) in handler. If less than body length, body will be truncated to match "content-length" value;
- "set-cookie" headers in response will be sent separately, while other duplicate headers will be combined;
- For requests containing "expect: 100-continue" header, calling request.body.read() will automatically send 100 status response to client. User-initiated 100 status responses are prohibited and treated as server errors.

Enabling h2 Service: tlsConfig's supportedAlpnProtocols must include "h2". If TLS layer ALPN negotiation results in h2, h2 service will be enabled.

h2 Request Validation and Processing:

- Headers name and value must comply with specific rules (see [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) class documentation). Additionally, names cannot contain uppercase characters, otherwise sends RST frame to close stream (no guaranteed response);
- Trailers name and value must follow same rules, otherwise closes stream;
- Headers cannot contain "connection", "transfer-encoding", "keep-alive", "upgrade", or "proxy-connection", otherwise closes stream;
- If "te" header exists, its value must be "trailers", otherwise closes stream;
- If both "host" header and ":authority" pseudo-header exist, their values must match, otherwise closes stream;
- If "content-length" header exists, all values must be parsable as Int64 type, and multiple values must be equal, otherwise closes stream;
- If "content-length" header exists with body, content-length value must match body size, otherwise closes stream;
- If "trailer" header exists, its values cannot contain "transfer-encoding", "trailer", or "content-length", otherwise closes stream;
- CONNECT method is only supported in [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) upgrade scenarios, otherwise closes stream;
- Pseudo-headers must include ":method", ":scheme", ":path". ":method" value must consist of token characters, ":scheme" must be "https", ":path" cannot be empty, otherwise closes stream;
- Trailer entry names must be included in "trailer" header, otherwise automatically removed;
- Request headers size cannot exceed maxHeaderListSize, otherwise closes connection.

h2 Response Validation and Processing:

- If HEAD request response contains body, it will be automatically removed;
- Automatically adds "date" field, user-provided "date" will be ignored;
- If headers contain "connection", "transfer-encoding", "keep-alive", "upgrade", or "proxy-connection", they will be automatically removed;
- "set-cookie" headers in response will be sent separately, while other duplicate headers will be combined;
- If headers contain "content-length" and method isn't "HEAD", "content-length" will be removed;
- If method is "HEAD":
    - If headers contain "content-length" but value is invalid (not parsable as Int64 or contains multiple unequal values), calling [HttpResponseWriter](http_package_classes.md#class-httpresponsewriter)'s write function throws [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception). If user handler has already completed, logs will be printed;
    - If headers contain "content-length" and response.body.length ≠ -1, but values don't match, same handling as 6.1;
    - If headers contain "content-length" and response.body.length = -1 or matches "content-length" value, retains "content-length" header;
- Trailer entries must be included in "trailer" header, otherwise automatically removed;
- If handler throws exception and user hasn't called write to send partial response, returns 500 response. If user has sent partial response, sends RST frame to close stream.

After h2 server sends response, if stream state isn't CLOSED, sends RST frame with NO_ERROR code to close stream, preventing processed streams from consuming server resources.

h2 Flow Control:

- Connection flow window initial value is 65535. Each received DATA frame returns a connection-level WINDOW-UPDATE. When sending DATA, if connection flow window is negative, blocks until positive;
- Stream flow window initial value can be user-configured (default 65535). Each received DATA frame returns a stream-level WINDOW-UPDATE. When sending DATA, if stream flow window is negative, blocks until positive.

h2 Request Prioritization:

- Supports urgency-based request processing. h2 service processes requests concurrently by default. When concurrent resources are insufficient, processes requests by urgency (higher priority first).

Default [ProtocolServiceFactory](http_package_interfaces.md#interface-protocolservicefactory) Protocol Selection:

- For TCP connections, uses HTTP/1.1 server;
- For TLS connections, determines HTTP version based on ALPN negotiation:
    - If result is "http/1.0", "http/1.1" or "", uses HTTP/1.1 server;
    - If result is "h2", uses HTTP/2 server;
    - Otherwise doesn't process request, logs and closes connection.

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown when port listening fails.

- [ServerBuilder](http_package_classes.md#class-serverbuilder) - Reference to the current [ServerBuilder](http_package_classes.md#class-serverbuilder).

## class WebSocket

```cangjie
public class WebSocket
```

Function: Provides a class for [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) services, offering functions for reading, writing, and closing [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) connections. Users can obtain a [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) connection via the `upgradeFrom` function.

- Call `read()` to read a [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe). Users can determine the frame type via [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe).frameType and whether it is a fragmented frame via [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe).fin.
- Call `write(frameType: WebSocketFrameType, byteArray: Array<UInt8>)` to send [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) messages by specifying the message type and message bytes. Control frames are sent without fragmentation, while data frames (Text, Binary) are fragmented according to the underlying buffer size (split into multiple fragments).

Detailed descriptions are provided in the interface documentation below. Interface behavior follows RFC 6455.

### prop logger

```cangjie
public prop logger: Logger
```

Function: Logger.

Type: [Logger](../../../log/log_package_api/log_package_classes.md#class-logger)

### prop subProtocol

```cangjie
public prop subProtocol: String
```

Function: Get the negotiated subProtocol with the peer. During negotiation, the client provides a ranked list of preferred subProtocols, and the server selects one or none.

Type: String

### static func upgradeFromClient(Client, URL, Protocol, ArrayList\<String>, HttpHeaders)

```cangjie
public static func upgradeFromClient(client: Client, url: URL,
 version!: Protocol = HTTP1_1,
 subProtocols!: ArrayList<String> = ArrayList<String>(),
 headers!: HttpHeaders = HttpHeaders()): (WebSocket, HttpHeaders)
```

Function: Provides a function for clients to upgrade to the [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) protocol.

> **Note:**
>
> The client upgrade process involves passing a client object and URL object, constructing an upgrade request, verifying the server's response. If the handshake succeeds, it returns a [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object for [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) communication and the [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) object from the 101 response. Extensions are not currently supported. If subprotocol negotiation succeeds, users can check the subprotocol via the returned [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket)'s subProtocol property.

Parameters:

- client: [Client](http_package_classes.md#class-client) - Client object for the request.
- url: [URL](../../../encoding/url/url_package_api/url_package_classes.md#class-url) - URL object for the request. Note that the URL scheme must be `ws` or `wss` for WebSocket upgrades.
- version!: [Protocol](http_package_enums.md#enum-protocol) - HTTP version used to create the socket. Only [HTTP1_1](./http_package_enums.md#enum-protocol) and [HTTP2_0](./http_package_enums.md#enum-protocol) are supported for WebSocket upgrades.
- subProtocols!: ArrayList\<String> - User-configured list of subprotocols, ranked by preference. Default is empty. If configured, it will be sent to the server with the upgrade request.
- headers!: [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) - Non-essential headers (e.g., cookies) to be sent with the upgrade request.

Return Value:

- ([WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket), HttpHeaders) - If the upgrade succeeds, returns a [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object for communication and the headers from the 101 response.

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown for underlying connection errors.
- [HttpException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-httpexception) - Thrown for HTTP request errors during the handshake.
- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown if the upgrade fails due to invalid response verification.

### static func upgradeFromServer(HttpContext, ArrayList\<String>, ArrayList\<String>, (HttpRequest) -> HttpHeaders)

```cangjie
public static func upgradeFromServer(ctx: HttpContext, subProtocols!: ArrayList<String> = ArrayList<String>(),
                                        origins!: ArrayList<String> = ArrayList<String>(),
                                        userFunc!:(HttpRequest) -> HttpHeaders = {_: HttpRequest => HttpHeaders()}): WebSocket
```

Function: Provides a function for servers to upgrade to the [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) protocol, typically used in handlers.

The server upgrade process involves receiving an upgrade request from the client, verifying the request, and replying with a 101 response if verification passes. It then returns a [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object for [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) communication.

- Users configure supported subprotocols and origin whitelists via the `subProtocols` and `origins` parameters. If `subProtocols` is not set, no subprotocols are supported. If `origins` is not set, all origin handshake requests are accepted.
- Users can customize upgrade request handling (e.g., processing cookies) via the `userFunc` parameter. The `userFunc` must return an [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) object, which is sent back to the client in the 101 response (failed upgrades do not return headers).
- WebSocket extensions are not currently supported. If extensions are negotiated during the handshake, a [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) is thrown.
- Only [HTTP1_1](./http_package_enums.md#enum-protocol) and [HTTP2_0](./http_package_enums.md#enum-protocol) are supported for WebSocket upgrades.

Parameters:

- ctx: [HttpContext](http_package_classes.md#class-httpcontext) - HTTP request context, passed directly from the handler to `upgradeFromServer`.
- subProtocols!: ArrayList\<String> - User-configured list of subprotocols. Default is empty (no support). If configured, the most preferred subprotocol from the upgrade request is selected as the WebSocket's subprotocol. Users can check the subprotocol via the returned [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket)'s subProtocol property.
- origins!: ArrayList\<String> - User-configured whitelist of allowed origins. If not configured, all origins are accepted. If configured, only requests from listed origins are accepted.
- userFunc!: ([HttpRequest](http_package_classes.md#class-httprequest)) ->[HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) - User-defined function for custom upgrade request handling. The function returns an [HttpHeaders](http_package_classes.md#class-httpheaders) object.

Return Value:

- [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) - The upgraded [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) instance.

### func closeConn()

```cangjie
public func closeConn(): Unit
```

Function: Provides a function to close the underlying [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) connection.

> **Note:**
>
> Directly closes the underlying connection. The standard closing process requires following the protocol's handshake procedure: first sending a Close frame to the peer and waiting for a Close frame response. The underlying connection should only be closed after the handshake completes.

### func read()

```cangjie
public func read(): WebSocketFrame
```

Function: Reads a frame from the connection. Blocks if data is not ready. Not thread-safe (i.e., multi-threaded reading on the same [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object is not supported).

The `read` function returns a [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe) object. Users can determine the frame type and whether it is fragmented via the [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe)'s `frameType` and `fin` properties. The raw binary data array (Array\<UInt8>) can be obtained via the [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe)'s `payload` function.

- The first fragment of a fragmented frame has `fin == false` and `frameType == TextWebFrame` or `BinaryWebFrame`.
- Intermediate fragments have `fin == false` and `frameType == ContinuationWebFrame`.
- The last fragment has `fin == true` and `frameType == ContinuationWebFrame`.
- Non-fragmented frames have `fin == true` and `frameType != ContinuationWebFrame`.

> **Note:**
>
> - Data frames (Text, Binary) can be fragmented. Users must call `read` multiple times to receive all fragments (referred to as receiving a complete message) and concatenate the payloads in order.
>     - Text frame payloads are UTF-8 encoded. After receiving a complete message, users can convert the concatenated payload to a string using `String.fromUtf8`.
>     - Binary frame payloads are application-specific. After receiving a complete message, users pass the concatenated payload to the upper-layer application.
> - Control frames (Close, Ping, Pong) cannot be fragmented.
> - Control frames cannot be fragmented but can be interleaved between fragmented data frames. Fragmented data frames cannot be interleaved with other data frames. If interleaved fragments are received, treat as an error.
> - Clients must receive masked frames; servers must receive unmasked frames. Otherwise, the underlying connection is closed, and an exception is thrown.
> - If rsv1, rsv2, or rsv3 bits are set (extensions are not supported, so these bits must be 0), the underlying connection is closed, and an exception is thrown.
> - If an unrecognized frame type is received (only Continuation, Text, Binary, Close, Ping, Pong are supported), the underlying connection is closed, and an exception is thrown.
> - If a fragmented or payload length exceeds 125 bytes for control frames (Close, Ping, Pong), the underlying connection is closed, and an exception is thrown.
> - If a payload length exceeds 20MB, the underlying connection is closed, and an exception is thrown.
> - If `read` is called after `closeConn` closes the connection, an exception is thrown.

Return Value:

- [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe) - The read [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe) object.

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown for underlying connection errors.
- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown if a frame violates protocol rules. A Close frame is sent to the peer with an error message, and the underlying connection is closed.
- [ConnectionException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-connectionexception) - Thrown if the peer closes the connection while reading.

### func write(WebSocketFrameType, Array\<UInt8>, Int64)

```cangjie
public func write(frameType: WebSocketFrameType, byteArray: Array<UInt8>, frameSize!: Int64 = FRAMESIZE): Unit
```

Function: Sends data. Not thread-safe (i.e., multi-threaded writing on the same [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object is not supported).

> **Note:**
>
> The `write` function sends data to the peer as a [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) frame.
>
> - For data frames (Text, Binary), if the `byteArray` exceeds `frameSize` (default 4 * 1024 bytes), it is split into payloads of `frameSize` or smaller and sent as fragmented frames. Otherwise, no fragmentation occurs.
> - For control frames (Close, Ping, Pong), the `byteArray` size must not exceed 125 bytes. Close frames include a 2-byte status code (valid codes are listed in RFC 6455 7.4. Status Codes). After sending a Close frame, sending data frames is prohibited and will throw an exception.
> - Users must ensure the `byteArray` complies with the protocol (e.g., Text frame payloads must be UTF-8 encoded). If `frameSize` is set for data frames, it must be greater than 0; otherwise, an exception is thrown.
> - If `frameSize` is less than or equal to 0 for data frames, an exception is thrown.
> - If a control frame's data exceeds 125 bytes, an exception is thrown.
> - If an unsupported frame type (not Text, Binary, Close, Ping, Pong) is passed, an exception is thrown.
> - If an invalid status code or reason exceeding 123 bytes is passed for Close frames, an exception is thrown.
> - If data frames are sent after a Close frame, an exception is thrown.
> - If `write` is called after `closeConn` closes the connection, an exception is thrown.

Parameters:

- frameType: [WebSocketFrameType](http_package_enums.md#enum-websocketframetype) - Type of frame to send.
- byteArray: Array\<UInt8> - Payload of the frame (in binary form).
- frameSize!: Int64 - Size of fragmented frames. Default is 4 * 1024 bytes. Does not apply to control frames (invalid if set).

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown for underlying connection errors.
- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown for invalid frame types or data.

### func writeCloseFrame(?UInt16, String)

```cangjie
public func writeCloseFrame(status!: ?UInt16 = None, reason!: String = ""): Unit
```

Function: Sends a Close frame.

> **Note:**
>
> After sending a Close frame, sending data frames is prohibited. If `status` is not set, `reason` is not sent (i.e., a reason requires a status). Control frame payloads must not exceed 125 bytes. Close frames include a 2-byte status code, so `reason` must not exceed 123 bytes. If `write` is called after `closeConn` closes the connection, an exception is thrown.

Parameters:

- status!: ?UInt16 - Status code for the Close frame. Default is `None` (no status or reason sent).
- reason!: String - Explanation for closing the connection. Default is an empty string. Sent as UTF-8 (readability not guaranteed; for debugging).

Exceptions:

- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown for invalid status codes or reasons exceeding 123 bytes.

### func writePingFrame(Array\<UInt8>)

```cangjie
public func writePingFrame(byteArray: Array<UInt8>): Unit
```

Function: Provides a shortcut for sending Ping frames. If `write` is called after `closeConn` closes the connection, an exception is thrown.

Parameters:

- byteArray: Array\<UInt8> - Payload of the frame (in binary form).

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown for underlying connection errors.
- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown if data exceeds 125 bytes.

### func writePongFrame(Array\<UInt8>)

```cangjie
public func writePongFrame(byteArray: Array<UInt8>): Unit
```

Function: Provides a shortcut for sending Pong frames. If `write` is called after `closeConn` closes the connection, an exception is thrown.

Parameters:

- byteArray: Array\<UInt8> - Payload of the frame (in binary form).

Exceptions:

- SocketException - Thrown for underlying connection errors.
- [WebSocketException](http_package_exceptions.md#class-websocketexception) - Thrown if data exceeds 125 bytes.

## class WebSocketFrame

```cangjie
public class WebSocketFrame
```

Function: The basic unit for reading in [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket).

[WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe) provides three properties: `fin` and `frameType` indicate whether the frame is fragmented and its type, while `payload` contains the frame's payload.

- The first fragment frame has `fin == false` and `frameType == TextWebFrame` or `BinaryWebFrame`.
- Intermediate frames have `fin == false` and `frameType == ContinuationWebFrame`.
- The last fragment frame has `fin == true` and `frameType == ContinuationWebFrame`.
- Non-fragmented frames have `fin == true` and `frameType != ContinuationWebFrame`.
- Users can only obtain [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe) objects via the [WebSocket](http_package_classes.md#class-websocket) object's `read` function. For fragmented data frames, users must call `read` repeatedly to receive the complete message and concatenate the payloads in order.

> **Note:**
>
> Control frames can be interleaved between fragment frames. Users must handle control frames separately when concatenating fragment payloads. Only control frames can be interleaved between fragments; interleaving other data frames is invalid and must be treated as an error.

### prop fin

```cangjie
public prop fin: Bool
```

Function: Retrieves the `fin` property of [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe). Together with `frameType`, it indicates whether the frame is fragmented and its type.

Type: Bool

### prop frameType

```cangjie
public prop frameType: WebSocketFrameType
```

Function: Gets the frame type of [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe). The combination of `fin` and `frameType` indicates whether the frame is fragmented and its type.

Type: [WebSocketFrameType](http_package_enums.md#enum-websocketframetype)

### prop payload

```cangjie
public prop payload: Array<UInt8>
```

Function: Gets the payload of [WebSocketFrame](http_package_classes.md#class-websocketframe). For fragmented data frames, users need to concatenate the payloads of all fragments in the order received after receiving the complete message.

Type: Array\<UInt8>

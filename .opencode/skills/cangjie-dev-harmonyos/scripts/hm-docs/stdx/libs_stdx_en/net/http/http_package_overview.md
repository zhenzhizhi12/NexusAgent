# stdx.net.http

## Feature Overview

The http package provides server and client implementations for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSocket protocols.

For detailed protocol specifications, please refer to [RFC 9110](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html), [9112](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html), [9113](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9113.html), [9218](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9218.html), [7541](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7541.html), etc.

This package requires external dependencies on `OpenSSL 3`'s `ssl` and `crypto` dynamic library files. Therefore, the following tools must be installed before use:

- For `Linux` operating systems:
    - If the system's package manager supports installing the `OpenSSL 3` development toolkit, you can install it this way. Ensure the system installation directory contains dynamic library files such as `libssl.so`, `libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so`, and `libcrypto.so.3`. For example, on `Ubuntu 22.04`, you can use the command `sudo apt install libssl-dev` to install the `libssl-dev` toolkit.
    - If the above method is unavailable, you can manually download and compile the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code. Ensure the installation directory contains `libssl.so`, `libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so`, and `libcrypto.so.3`. Then, choose one of the following methods to ensure the system linker can locate these files:
        - If OpenSSL is not installed on the system, install it directly to the system path.
        - For custom installation directories, add the directory containing these files to the environment variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`.
- For `Windows` operating systems:
    - Manually download and compile the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code for x64 architecture, or download and install a third-party precompiled `OpenSSL 3.x.x` developer package.
    - Ensure the installation directory contains library files such as `libssl.dll.a` (or `libssl.lib`), `libssl-3-x64.dll`, `libcrypto.dll.a` (or `libcrypto.lib`), and `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`.
    - Add the directory containing `libssl.dll.a` (or `libssl.lib`) and `libcrypto.dll.a` (or `libcrypto.lib`) to the `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. Add the directory containing `libssl-3-x64.dll` and `libcrypto-3-x64.dll` to the `PATH` environment variable.
- For `macOS` operating systems:
    - Use `brew install openssl@3` to install, ensuring the system installation directory contains dynamic library files `libcrypto.dylib` and `libcrypto.3.dylib`.
    - If the above method is unavailable, manually download and compile the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code. Ensure the installation directory contains `libcrypto.dylib` and `libcrypto.3.dylib`. Then, choose one of the following methods to ensure the system linker can locate these files:
        - If OpenSSL is not installed on the system, install it directly to the system path.
        - For custom installation directories, add the directory containing these files to the environment variables `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`.

If the `OpenSSL 3` package is not installed or an older version is installed, the program may fail to function and throw TLS-related exceptions.

### HTTP

Users can select the HTTP protocol version, such as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. Most APIs in the http package do not distinguish between these versions. Only when using version-specific features (e.g., chunked transfer-encoding in HTTP/1.1 or server push in HTTP/2) is such distinction necessary.

The http library defaults to HTTP/1.1. To use HTTP/2, developers must configure TLS for the Client/Server and set the ALPN value to `h2`. Upgrading from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 via `Upgrade: h2c` is not supported.

If HTTP/2 connection handshake fails, the Client/Server will automatically fall back to HTTP/1.1.

- Users construct a Client instance via [ClientBuilder](./http_package_api/http_package_classes.md#class-clientbuilder), specifying parameters such as httpProxy, logger, cookieJar, auto-redirect, connection pool size, etc.

- Users construct a Server instance via [ServerBuilder](./http_package_api/http_package_classes.md#class-serverbuilder), specifying parameters such as addr, port, logger, distributor, etc.

If users need to set their own Logger, it must be thread-safe.

Most parameters of Client and Server cannot be modified after construction. To change them, users must construct a new Client or Server instance. If a parameter supports dynamic modification, this implementation will provide explicit functionality, such as hot updates for Server-side cert and CA.

- Using a Client instance, users can send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses.

- Using a Server instance, users can configure request forwarding handlers and start an HTTP server. In the server handler, users can obtain detailed request information from the client via HttpContext and construct responses to send back.

The Server creates corresponding ProtocolService instances based on client requests. A single Server instance can simultaneously support both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

- On the client side, users construct requests via HttpRequestBuilder, specifying parameters such as method, url, version, headers, body, trailers, etc. Once constructed, the request cannot be modified.

- On the server side, users construct responses via HttpResponseBuilder, specifying parameters such as status, headers, body, trailers, etc. Once constructed, the response cannot be modified.

Additionally, this implementation provides utility classes for constructing common responses, such as RedirectHandler for redirect responses and NotFoundHandler for 404 responses.

### WebSocket

This implementation provides WebSocket sub-protocol negotiation, including basic frame decoding, reading, message sending, frame encoding, ping, pong, and closing functionalities.

Users upgrade from an HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 Client instance to WebSocket protocol via WebSocket.upgradeFromClient, then communicate using the returned WebSocket instance.

In a server-side handler, users upgrade from HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 to WebSocket protocol via WebSocket.upgradeFromServer, then communicate using the returned WebSocket instance.

Per protocol:

- In HTTP/1.1, the upgraded WebSocket connection is established over a TCP/TLS connection.
- In HTTP/2, the upgraded WebSocket connection is established over a stream within an HTTP/2 connection.
- In HTTP/1.1, closing terminates the TCP/TLS connection.
- In HTTP/2, closing only terminates the stream on the connection.

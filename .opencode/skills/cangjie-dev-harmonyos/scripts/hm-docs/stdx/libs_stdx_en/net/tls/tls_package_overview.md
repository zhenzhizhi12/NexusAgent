# stdx.net.tls

## Feature Description

The tls package is used for secure encrypted network communication, providing capabilities such as creating TLS servers, performing TLS handshakes based on protocols, sending/receiving encrypted data, and resuming TLS sessions.

This package supports TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 Transport Layer Security protocol communication.

To use this package, external dependencies on the `ssl` and `crypto` dynamic library files of `OpenSSL 3` are required. Therefore, the following tools must be installed beforehand:

- For **Linux** operating systems, refer to the following methods:
    - If the system's package manager supports installing the `OpenSSL 3` development toolkit, install it this way and ensure the system installation directory contains dynamic library files such as `libssl.so`, `libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so`, and `libcrypto.so.3`. For example, on `Ubuntu 22.04`, use the command `sudo apt install libssl-dev` to install the `libssl-dev` toolkit.
    - If installation via the above method is not possible, manually download the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code, compile, and install the package. Ensure the installation directory contains dynamic library files such as `libssl.so`, `libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so`, and `libcrypto.so.3`. Then, choose one of the following methods to ensure the system linker can locate these files:
        - For systems without OpenSSL installed, select the system path for installation.
        - For custom installation directories, add the directory containing these files to the environment variables `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`.

- For **Windows** operating systems, follow these steps:
    - Manually download the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code, compile, and install the x64 architecture package, or download and install a third-party precompiled `OpenSSL 3.x.x` package for developers.
    - Ensure the installation directory contains library files such as `libssl.dll.a` (or `libssl.lib`), `libssl-3-x64.dll`, `libcrypto.dll.a` (or `libcrypto.lib`), and `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`.
    - Add the directory paths containing `libssl.dll.a` (or `libssl.lib`) and `libcrypto.dll.a` (or `libcrypto.lib`) to the `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. Add the directory paths containing `libssl-3-x64.dll` and `libcrypto-3-x64.dll` to the `PATH` environment variable.

- For **macOS** operating systems, refer to the following methods:
    - Use `brew install openssl@3` to install and ensure the system installation directory contains the dynamic library files `libcrypto.dylib` and `libcrypto.3.dylib`.
    - If installation via the above method is not possible, manually download the `OpenSSL 3.x.x` source code, compile, and install the package. Ensure the installation directory contains the dynamic library files `libcrypto.dylib` and `libcrypto.3.dylib`. Then, choose one of the following methods to ensure the system linker can locate these files:
        - For systems without OpenSSL installed, select the system path for installation.
        - For custom installation directories, add the directory containing these files to the environment variables `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH`.

> **Note:**
>
> If the `OpenSSL 3` package is not installed or a lower version is installed, the program may fail to function and throw the exception `TlsException: Can not load openssl library or function xxx.`.
